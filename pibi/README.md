# Pibi

Based on `ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite:testing`, with DX development/ROCm tools,
Linux VMs and GPU passthrough, Ghostty, Helium and Podman. KDE desktop, without
Gaming Mode defaults.

## Build and publish

From `pibi/`:

```sh
just build
```

CI builds PRs and publishes `ghcr.io/pixelcmtd/pibi:latest` daily and on
relevant pushes to `daddy`. One-time signing setup:

```sh
cosign generate-key-pair
gh secret set SIGNING_SECRET < cosign.key
gh secret set COSIGN_PASSWORD
```

Commit `cosign.pub`, keep `cosign.key` private, and make the GHCR package
public. Builds require the public key. `cosign` is in the base Brewfile.

## Switch

After the first publication:

```sh
sudo bash ./trust.sh cosign.pub &&
  sudo rpm-ostree uninstall ghostty helium-bin &&
  brh rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/pixelcmtd/pibi:latest &&
  sudo systemctl reboot
```

Run this on the PC where you generated the key. It trusts that local public key
for Pibi and requires its signature for the rebase and updates. One reboot.
VSCodium comes from `pikd/Brewfile`, its extensions from `kilobase/Brewfile`.

After rebooting, install the Flatpak defaults:

```sh
ujust install-flatpaks
```

## VM setup

If the machine still needs virtualization and GPU passthrough configured:

```sh
ujust setup-virtualization virt-on
ujust setup-virtualization vfio-on
```

Follow the helper's device-binding instructions, then reboot. Existing VM
configuration carries over when rebasing.
