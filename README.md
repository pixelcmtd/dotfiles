## **Pi**xie's **K**DE **D**esktop (`pikd`)

Installs a few desktop apps, developed and tested on Bazzite (DX) and Fedora
Asahi:

```sh
curl -L https://github.com/pixelcmtd/dotfiles/raw/daddy/install | sh -s pikd
```

## **c**hrissx **M**edia **m**acOS **S**etup **S**cripts (`cmmss`)

A set of scripts for easily installing a lot of packages and configuration,
primarily on "Apple silicon" (ARM), currently macOS 15 Sequoia.

> [!WARNING]
> Older macOS versions, as well as Intel-based versions are unsupported. Expect
> to run into issues, patching them should be pretty easy though.

> [!NOTE]
> CMMSS should work on macOS 26, but it is currently also untested.

- Grant Terminal Full Disk Access (in the System Settings)
- Install [XCode](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/xcode/id497799835) from the App
  Store (`open -a "App Store" https://apps.apple.com/de/app/xcode/id497799835`)
  or [Apple Developer page](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=Xcode)
- Run `sudo xcodebuild -license` and agree to the license
- Run
  `curl -L https://github.com/pixelcmtd/dotfiles/raw/daddy/install | sh -s cmmss`
- Open iTerm, go to the Preferences (⌘,): General → Preferences →
  `Load preferences from a custom folder or URL` →
  `/Users/your_name/src/pixelcmtd/dotfiles/cmmss`

### Other software (esp. audio plugins)

A lot of software, especially audio plugins, isn't in Homebrew, or otherwise
easily automatable. This may be seen as a long to-do list.

## `base`

> [!NOTE]
> `base` is not intended for individual install, but for installation through
> one of the config systems listed above.

Finishes up the install, specifically the following steps:

- disable brew analytics
- install [many homebrew formulae](base/Brewfile)
- install rust stable from `rustup`
- install [a few cargo packages](base/packages.cargo)
- install `goimports`
- disable dart analytics
- install flutter stable from `fvm`
- clone a big list of repos into `~/src`

## Updating

Using `topgrade` to update all installed packages is recommended. To keep
configurations in sync, `git pull && ./run base` (maybe `./run cmmss`,
`./run caamo`, etc) should usually do the trick. In some cases, manual patches
might be required after major changes.
